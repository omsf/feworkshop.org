In this page we provide an overview of the purpose of the conference and the themes that have been covered in conferences previously.

## About the Conference

This workshop focuses on free energy techniques—the latest innovations and use cases, force field parameterization as it touches these techniques, and sampling practices, among other things. We as organizers believe that these techniques are even closer than before to making an impact in appropriate drug discovery applications, by allowing physics-based prediction of physical properties such as binding affinity, selectivity, solubility, and membrane permeability. However, a number of challenges still remain. This workshop provides a unique opportunity to assess where we are today and what challenges must be tackled next to bring the potential of free energy techniques to bear on real-world applications. We also seek to identify particular problems in drug discovery where these methods can have an impact.

Our goal in this workshop is to bring together experts from pharmaceutical and supporting industries, as well as academia, in an intense and focused workshop to identify challenges and help chart the path forward. We are particularly interested in hearing about use cases, pitfalls and their solutions, and so on. We also firmly believe we can learn a great deal from failure, so we hope participants will go beyond just highlighting success stories to provide more detailed insight into successes and failures.

Additionally, the conference will serve as an opportunity for students and young scientists to network with more well known names in the field. We hope to cultivate an environment where new ideas and collaborations can be easily forged.
