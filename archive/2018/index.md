# Description
The 2018 workshop titled **2018 Workshop on Free Energy Methods, Kinetics and Markov State Models in Drug Design** brought together scientists from academia and industry to explore how advanced computational techniques—particularly alchemical free-energy methods, kinetic modelling, and Markov State Models (MSMs)—can influence drug-design workflows. The meeting was held May 14-18th, 2018. The sessions covered the state of the art in binding-free-energy calculations, force-field parameterisation, and the emerging importance of modelling ligand kinetics (on- and off-rates) in addition to binding affinity; they emphasized integrating these methods into real-world medicinal-chemistry pipelines, while also addressing challenges such as sampling bottlenecks, reproducibility, and community benchmarking.
