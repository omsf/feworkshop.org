# Description
The European Alchemical Free Energy Workshop was held on May 27-28, 2019. BioExcel, the leading European Centre of Excellence for Computational Biomolecular Research, organized the event with a high-level lineup of speakers from both academia and industry. The current event is hosted and organized by the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen.

Over the two days, the event gathered free energy calculation practitioners and method developers, both from academia and industry. In the spirit of similar previous workshops, we are interested in hearing about use cases, pitfalls and their solutions, as well as challenges and possible paths forward for improvement.
